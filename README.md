# Blockchain_investigation_2
This is a extension to the Blockchain project already inside my repository collection (Blockchain_Investigation). Now this extension I have connected Visual studio code to Microsoft Fabric to gain access to two tables inside a database, which i already have established there. Afterwards, I have connected Chatgpt and configured it to understand the data; then finally I have created a App to be as a interface to simplify usage of the Code.

Why?
Essentially, this will be a website link where you have simple instructions on how to question your data instead of asking questions in the terminal. (Which in most cases some people donâ€™t have the programming instruments) Therefore the user can just go on the link and ask questions.
